My name is Edward Gyubeom Im. I obtained my Master's Degree in Department of Transdisciplinary Studies, The Gradudate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University.

Main keywords of my researches are <b>SLAM, Visual Odometry, Long-term Localization, Autonomous Navigation</b>. You can find my Curriculum Vitae(CV) [here](/assets/cv.pdf) (last updated: 2020.08).
