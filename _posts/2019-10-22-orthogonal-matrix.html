<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A matrix $\mathbf{U}$is known as <i>orthogonal</i> <span class="underline">if its transpose is its inverse</span> -symbolically $\mathbf{U}^{T}\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$is the identity matrix. this means that the column vectors of $\mathbf{U}$are all of unit norm and are orthogonal. this may be written $\mathbf{u}_{i}^{T}\mathbf{u}_{j}=\delta_{ij}$. from the condition $\mathbf{U}^{T} \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}$one easily deduces that $\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^{T}=\mathbf{I}$. hence the row vectors of $\mathbf{U}$are also of unit norm and are orthogonal.</li>
<li>consider once more the equation $\mathbf{U}^{T}\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{I}$, taking determiants leads to the equation $(\det{\mathbf{U}})^{2}=1$, since $\det{\mathbf{U}} = \det{\mathbf{U}}^{T}$. Thus if $\mathbf{U}$is orthogonal, then $\det \mathbf{U} = \pm 1$</li>
</ul>
